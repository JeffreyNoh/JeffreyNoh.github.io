      <description>Picture this: you walk into your favorite NHL teams’ home ice rink. What is the first thing that you see? Probably the giant screens hanging above center ice known as a jumbotron. You examine the opponents’ statistics. As your eyes make their way down the list, you see a small box labeled “Shots.”
Most of the time you would overlook it and pay little to no attention to it, but when you look past the fact that it is just a number on a screen, and dig into the statistics, the number of shots is a very interesting category.</description>
